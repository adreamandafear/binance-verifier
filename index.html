  Welcome to my binance trade compressor. So I saw a couple of posts about people worried that their binance balances weren't accurate, and that there was some bug based on cancelled limit orders. As a hobby day trader, this got me a bit worried, and so I spent an hour or two and wrote a simple webpage that lets you upload your trade history from Binance, and will compress it into the net change in coins. Figured I'd share in case anyone else is feeling paranoid :)
   <li> On binance, click "Export Complete Order History" </li>
   <li> Click past 3 months, then Export </li>
   <li> Upload the file below </li>
   <li> Check that the number beside each coin matches Deposits - withdrawals + Binance balance </li>

  Caveats: This does not include fees in transactions, so a few dollars here and there discrepancy is expected especially if you don't use the BNB fee discount. This also doesn't account for NEO GAS dividends. If you find any bugs, please send me the console errors via reddit u/adreamandafear. Based on this, I didn't find any discrepancies between what binance showed, and what was expected, so yay binance :)
